# README

Hey there!! Welcome to my capstone project:)
I am going to be logging all my thoughts, findings, and most importantly my accomplishments!! Thanks for joining me on this journey.

🧠 Today I decided on what my app was going to be about, and setteled on a consignment shop. I did this because I want to be invested in my app and enjoy spending time on it (and who doesnt love good deals, and making some 💰)

📝 My next step was wire framing, planning out the user stories, the models, and assosiations. It was pretty straight forward. Wire framing is definetly a favorite of mine (I actually gave a little crash course to my cohort on figma which was pretty neat).

👩‍🏫 Had a meeting with Amanda (My instructor) to go over all my planning, and make sure my MVP was actually an MVP;) She gave me the go ahead to start coding🥳

🛠️ Built the bare bones of my app. The models, controllers, jbuilders, and routes. I started making all the CRUD actions for the user but something got borked with the password. I guess that will be tomorrows activity!!

⛔️ I started off the day on a great foot!! played around with the routes and that fixed the password digest, then i finished CRUD for the index gave some assosiations, and im ready to start with user identification and sessions! wish me luck:)

🥳 Finished MVP for backend, got the sessions rolling and you need a jwt to add a product. I taking a leap and opening up frontend although I will probably need to come back (no pun intednded;) here an edit in the future. but for now.... wheeeee 🏁

😅 I got all the basic components in place and then connected to my backend. I made the item and user index and show. Then made them all link up to eachother. I got crazy stuck when my user show page would not show the user data!!! until I read through my code 1000 times and realized that I didn't pass in users as props🤦‍♀️ but all good now. Now that basic content is all good the next step i'm going to take is adding in the header with all its features.

👏 I'm super proud of myself today. I feel like I took great steps twards my goal. I am so much more comfortable with linking pages and axios requests after today. Being forced out on my own and challenging myself not to ask for help unless I tried my best really pushed me to accomplish and acheive so much on my own!! I'm super confidant with my app and I hope to see great strides in the coming days!! That's a wrap😊

🤓 I cleaned up the header with conditionals to only show the appropriate links. I then stored current user id in local storage so i can access from any component!! (thanks kevin👏) I created the current user profile link, and set it up with the name. Now I got a little stuck trying to render the items from the user. I think i am going to try to render the items witht the correct user_id instead. I'll let you know how it goes!!

🥳 It worked! although I got stuck for a little while when trying to map through the items that have the correct user_id. Figured out that i need to filter and not find, then i was using three ===, and it only worked with two. I'm glad we passed that bump. Onto bigger and better!! next step is going to be editing a product so the owner can CRUD it.

🤨 I just spent way too long trying to make a modal, so I think I'm going to just go back to good old routing. Maybe ill give modal some more time, but for now i'm going to close when its not broken. Who likes broken code? Only had 2 hours today but still got a lot done!! Happy Holidays:)

😬 Went on a little holiday so had a long break, which made continuing to build more of a challenge. I made the create action for items, as well as the edit and delete. The next step is going to be making sure each page has the correct headers which is going to entail adding some validations. After that I am going to ensure all the nessisary data is being displayed, then import some basic bootstrap.
